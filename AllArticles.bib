Extensively revised and expanded, the second edition contains completely new material, including a discussion of the radiative transfer equation, atmospheric sounding techniques and interferometric radar and a discussion of GPS. Also including numerous problems with solutions, this book forms the basis of an introductory course for students  in remote sensing, geography, cartography, surveying, meteorology, earth sciences and environmental sciences. It will also be an essential reference for researchers and a useful supplementary text in some physics, mathematics and engineering " # "courses.",
